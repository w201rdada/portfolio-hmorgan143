## Need for upgrades

The American paper industry has been well established for decades, with some mills continuously operating for over a hundred years. While many innovations have occurred in the operating technology, progress in the reporting and analytical technology has vastly fallen behind. Many papermakers didn't see the need: Why spend the money on something that isn't going to make the machine run faster, or cause fewer paper breaks? They argued that investment dollars were better spent on new chemicals or new showerhead combinations. However, as technology has gotten cheaper those arguments don’t hold as much sway. And with the cost of materials rising, mills are being pressured to squeeze every good ton of paper they can out of their existing equipment. 

## Technology needs to be brought not just to the present, but to the future

Most mills have the solutions to best operations within their grasp, they just don’t know how to access it. One of the first steps to building a data science tool is having good data to analyze, and most modern mills do have extensive data historians. These hold temperatures, tonnage, shift schedules and many other bits and pieces of information that could prove helpful. They also have data visualization software to display this data, either PI or Parcview or some other program. And while each program has its own set of analytical tools, they fail to fully bridge the gap between data visualization and data analytics. That is where my software suite would come in. A multi-faceted collection of tools, my software will build upon current data historian and visualization software to add intelligence to the data. Some of the modules that will be included are reject analysis to identify constant speed bottlenecking, shift analysis of production to identify crews who either need new more training or should be recruited to train their coworkers, and machine learning applications to try and predict certain types of sheet breaks before they happen. Various parties may already do some of this analysis, but often it is one-off analysis that is based in excel and hard to adjust, update, or reformat. My tools will bring everything to a single place, and provide users with the flexibility they need. All of this is done as real time as physically possible. Once the platform is built to quickly do these kinds of analysis projects, as new ideas become available they can be tested and added.  

## Physical impacts with information

The new control charts for rejects will help operators address problems sooner, and result in a lower percentage of thrown out paper. The shift analysis will lead to a better trained workforce that operates the mill more homogenously. The sheet break predictor will allow for changes to be made to mitigate the break before it happens, leading to less downtime and more production. And while the technology exists to create these tools, some challenges do exist to implementation. In addition to the cost in time and money to code and buy technology, there is also the people factor – one of the biggest problems will be convincing mills that the way they have run for the last 50 years can be done better, and that they should trust the judgements of the computer. However, I believe that these modules and all future ones will wipe the doubt out and help current paper mills maximize their existing equipment with relatively little cost. We will make the machine run faster, and we will do it with fewer paper breaks.
