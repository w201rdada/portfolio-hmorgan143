<div id="why-do-we-need-chemicals" class="section level2">
<h2>Why do we need chemicals</h2>
<p>When the general public thinks of the composition paper, most people can come up with that is it made from trees, or it is recycled from other paper. What is often not thought of is sheer number of chemicals that also go into making paper to create different paper properties. There are thousands of grades of paper, with different properties that are important to all of them. Some of those properties include strength, tear, porosity, and color. The correct cocktail of chemicals can greatly influence the outcomes of these properties. While general industry knowledge gives an idea of where to start, each mill is unique in how fiber is brought to the machine, and the specific chemicals applied on the machine to make sure that test is made. However, chemicals are very expensive, and can cost a mill hundreds of thousands of dollars a week. That is where my tool, SmartChem, would come in.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-can-we-control-them" class="section level2">
<h2>How can we control them</h2>
<p>Using advanced machine learning techniques, SmartChem, a subsidiary of SmartMill, will look at history to create models of the perfect formulation of chemicals needed to meet test properties. It will use chemical flow data, as well as other process data (consistency, temperature, pressure, etc). My tool will save the customer in two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The tool will ensure that enough chemicals are used so that the paper produced meets test requirements and rejects are reduced.</li>
<li>The tool will ensure that not too many chemicals are being used and wasted.</li>
</ol>
<p>At initialization, my tool will require some time to set up, as extensive history must be looked at to create the model. Industry research and knowledge can also be used to make initial assumptions and build in more knowledge. However, the power of this tool is using machine learning to adjust its predictions based upon feedback and changing machine conditions. SmartChem also stands above competition in its uniqueness to each mill site and its ability to provide customized solutions.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-are-obstacles-to-optimization" class="section level2">
<h2>What are obstacles to optimization</h2>
<p>The initial set up for SmartChem will be a lot of work. We will need to identify not just all the potential chemical flows, but also other the contributing factors to paper quality. In addition to identifying and adding all of these variables to the model, there could be instrumentation issues. Paper mills are old, and often not all pipes have flowmeters or other sensors. In order for this product to be successful, the customer will have to be extremely involved in the set up and implementation so that mill knowledge can be properly leveraged. However, that relationship that is built between SmartChem and the mill site will lead to personalized and sustainable solutions. As the industry shrinks, tools like SmartChem will be the edge for paper mills to remain competitive without capital investment.</p>
