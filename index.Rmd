What is the first thing you think of when you think Data Science? Based upon a very skewed survey of friends and family, most people think of Google, Facebook, computers, and technology. But ultimately, the data part of Data Science can be anything - and if it can be anything, why not manufacturing data? Most manufacturing facilities already collect mountains of data on their product and process. Their data just needs to be married to the tools of Data Science. In my ideas, I will outline some paths this union might take, focusing on the pulp and paper industry.
