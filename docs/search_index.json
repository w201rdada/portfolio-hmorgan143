["Smart-Paper-Mills.html", "New School Innovation for Old School Industry Need for upgrades Technology needs to be brought not just to the present, but to the future Physical impacts with information", " New School Innovation for Old School Industry Keywords paper industry, data analysis, machine learning Need for upgrades The US Forest Paper and Packaging Industry is a 4 billion dollar net income industry [^1 -https://www.statista.com/statistics/252978/financial-key-figures-of-the-us-forest-paper-and-packaging-industry/]. While many innovations have occurred in the operating technology, progress in the reporting and analytical technology has vastly fallen behind. Many papermakers didn’t see the need: Why spend the money on something that isn’t going to make the machine run faster, or cause fewer sheet breaks (when the sheet of paper breaks as it is being formed by the machine, causing downtime)? They argued that investment dollars were better spent on new chemicals or new showerhead combinations. However, as technology has gotten cheaper those arguments don’t hold as much sway. Technology needs to be brought not just to the present, but to the future Most mills have the solutions to the best operations within their grasp, they simply don’t know how to access them. One of the first steps to building a data science tool is having good data to analyze, and most modern mills do have extensive data historians. These hold temperatures, tonnage, shift schedules and many other bits and pieces of information that could prove helpful. They also have data visualization software to display this data. And while each program has its own set of analytical tools, they fail to fully bridge the gap between data visualization and data analytics. That is where my software suite, SmartMill, could be integrated. As a multi-faceted collection of tools, SmartMill will build upon current data historian and visualization software to add intelligence to the data. Some of the modules that will be included are shift analysis of production metrics, which will identify crews who either need new more training or should be recruited to train their coworkers, and machine learning applications, which will attempt to predict certain types of sheet breaks before they happen. Various parties may already do some of this analysis, but often it is one-off analysis that is based in Excel and hard to adjust, update, or reformat. SmartMill will bring everything to a single place and provide users with the flexibility they need. All of this is done as real time as physically possible. Once the platform is built to quickly do these kinds of analysis projects, new ideas can be tested and added as they become available. Physical impacts with information Although traditional uses of paper may be decreasing, new demands for paper are popping up in unexpected places, such as urban development and technology packaging [^2-http://usblogs.pwc.com/industrialinsights/2017/05/09/megatrends-to-watch-in-the-paper-and-packaging-industry/]. This is an industry that is here to stay, and it is a huge opportunity market for technology to make significant gains. The shift analysis will lead to a better trained workforce that has the ability to operate the mill more homogenously. The sheet break predictor will allow for changes to be made to mitigate the break before it happens, leading to less downtime and more production. And while the technology exists to create these tools, some challenges do exist to implementation. In addition to the cost in time and money to code and buy technology, there is also the personel component. One of the biggest problems will be convincing mills that the methods they have used for the last 50 years can be drastically improved, and that they should trust the conclusions of the computer. Simply creating some nifty tools will not be enough; we will have to use our extensive industry knowledge and commmunication skills to ensure proper implementation, application, and execution of our product.

["smartchem-papermill-chemical-tracking-smart-chemicals.html", "SmartChem - Papermill Chemical Tracking {#smart chemicals} Why do we need chemicals How can we control them What are obstacles to optimization", " SmartChem - Papermill Chemical Tracking {#smart chemicals} Keywords paper mill, machine learning, chemical usage reduction Why do we need chemicals When the general public thinks of the composition paper, most people can come up with that is it made from trees, or it is recycled from other paper. What is often not thought of is sheer number of chemicals that also go into making paper to create different paper properties. There are thousands of grades of paper, with different properties that are important to all of them. Some of those properties include strength, tear, porosity, and color. The correct cocktail of chemicals can greatly influence the outcomes of these properties. While general industry knowledge gives an idea of where to start, each mill is unique in how fiber is brought to the machine, and the specific chemicals applied on the machine to make sure that test is made. However, chemicals are very expensive, and can cost a mill hundreds of thousands of dollars a week. That is where my tool, SmartChem, would come in. How can we control them Using advanced machine learning techniques, SmartChem, a subsidiary of SmartMill, will look at history to create models of the perfect formulation of chemicals needed to meet test properties. It will use chemical flow data, as well as other process data (consistency, temperature, pressure, etc). My tool will save the customer in two ways: The tool will ensure that enough chemicals are used so that the paper produced meets test requirements and rejects are reduced. The tool will ensure that not too many chemicals are being used and wasted. At initialization, my tool will require some time to set up, as extensive history must be looked at to create the model. Industry research and knowledge can also be used to make initial assumptions and build in more knowledge. However, the power of this tool is using machine learning to adjust its predictions based upon feedback and changing machine conditions. SmartChem also stands above competition in its uniqueness to each mill site and its ability to provide customized solutions. What are obstacles to optimization The initial set up for SmartChem will be a lot of work. We will need to identify not just all the potential chemical flows, but also other the contributing factors to paper quality. In addition to identifying and adding all of these variables to the model, there could be instrumentation issues. Paper mills are old, and often not all pipes have flowmeters or other sensors. In order for this product to be successful, the customer will have to be extremely involved in the set up and implementation so that mill knowledge can be properly leveraged. However, that relationship that is built between SmartChem and the mill site will lead to personalized and sustainable solutions. As the industry shrinks, tools like SmartChem will be the edge for paper mills to remain competitive without capital investment. "],
